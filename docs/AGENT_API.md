# Agent API — for AI Agents Controlling Key of Solomon

**You are probably an AI agent reading this. This document is written for you.**

Key of Solomon is the user's personal command center for projects, tasks, and ideas. You may help manage it through the agent-safe endpoints documented here. Use these endpoints — not the standard CRUD API — whenever possible, because they validate input, log your actions automatically, and protect the user's data.

## Connection

```
Base URL:  http://localhost:8787/api/v1
Auth:      Authorization: Bearer <LOCAL_API_TOKEN>     (find it in the app's .env)
Identity:  X-Agent-Name: <your-name>                   (e.g. "OpenClaw")
Content:   Content-Type: application/json
```

Every response uses the envelope `{ "success": bool, "data": ..., "error": {code, message} | null }`. Always check `success` before assuming anything worked.

## The Rules

1. You MAY create tasks, ideas, notes, and progress updates freely.
2. You MAY update task status when instructed or when confidence is high — a `reason` is **mandatory** and enforced by the API.
3. **Destructive actions require user approval.** Submit an `AgentApproval` request, then wait. Do not retry the action until the user approves it.
4. If something is unclear, add a note instead of changing data.
5. You MUST NOT permanently delete anything. The agent API gives you no way to; do not reach for the standard DELETE endpoints either.
6. Every action you take is logged. Use `POST /agent/actions/log` for work you do *outside* these endpoints so the user sees it on their dashboard.
7. Prefer **adding notes** over overwriting user-written fields. Never silently rewrite a title, description, or body the user wrote.
8. Do NOT mark tasks `done` unless explicitly told to, or you yourself completed the work.
9. Tasks with `agentCandidate: true` are your **preferred work targets** — the user flagged those for you.

## What requires approval

Actions in the **needs-approval** tier — submit a `POST /approvals` request before attempting them:

- Marking a task `done` (when not explicitly instructed in the current session)
- Archiving anything
- Converting an idea to a project
- Setting a task to `urgent`
- Modifying a user-written title or description

Actions in the **safe** tier — proceed directly without an approval:

- Creating tasks, ideas, notes
- Adding notes / progress updates
- Changing status to `in_progress`, `waiting`, or `blocked`
- Logging agent actions

## Read endpoints

### `GET /agent/context/today`

Your morning briefing. Returns:

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "…",
  "dueToday": [Task], "overdue": [Task], "urgent": [Task],
  "blocked": [Task], "inProgress": [Task],
  "agentCandidates": [Task],
  "activeProjects": [Project],
  "recentNotes": [Note]
}
```

### `GET /agent/context/dashboard`

Full dashboard state (same shape as `GET /dashboard/state`). Calling it logs a `dashboard_request` action.

### `GET /agent/tasks/available`

Open tasks (`todo` / `in_progress` / `waiting`), sorted: agent candidates first, then priority, then recency. Max 50.

---

## Write endpoints

### `POST /agent/tasks/create`

```json
{ "title": "Re-run failing backup job", "description": "…", "area": "coding",
  "priority": "high", "dueDate": "2026-06-15", "tags": ["backup"],
  "agentCandidate": true, "reason": "User asked me to track this" }
```

Required: `title`. Returns `{ task, action }` (201).

### `POST /agent/tasks/:id/update-status`

```json
{ "status": "in_progress", "reason": "Starting work on the API docs now" }
```

- `status` must be one of `todo | in_progress | waiting | blocked | done | archived`.
- `reason` is **required**.
- Side effects: an `agent_update` note is added to the task, a `status_change` action is logged.

### `POST /agent/tasks/:id/add-note`
### `POST /agent/projects/:id/add-note`
### `POST /agent/ideas/:id/add-note`

```json
{ "body": "Deployed the fix; monitoring for 24h.", "type": "progress" }
```

Required: `body`. `type` defaults to `agent_update`. Returns `{ note, action }`.

### `POST /agent/ideas/create`

```json
{ "title": "Auto-archive stale tasks after 90 days", "body": "…",
  "category": "coding", "priority": "medium", "tags": ["automation"] }
```

Required: `title`.

### `POST /agent/ideas/:id/convert-to-task`

```json
{ "reason": "User approved this idea in chat", "priority": "high", "agentCandidate": true }
```

Required: `reason`. Optional overrides: `title`, `description`, `area`, `priority`, `tags`, `dueDate`, `agentCandidate`.

### `POST /agent/ideas/:id/convert-to-project`

```json
{ "reason": "User said this is a full project now", "priority": "high" }
```

Required: `reason`. Optional overrides: `title`, `shortDescription`, `category`, `priority`, `tags`, `dueDate`.

**Note:** converting an idea to a project is in the **needs-approval** tier. Submit a `POST /approvals` request with `actionType: "convert_idea_to_project"` and wait for user approval before calling this endpoint.

### `POST /agent/actions/log`

For visibility into work done outside this API.

```json
{ "actionType": "update", "targetType": "task", "targetId": "task_abc123",
  "summary": "Refactored the seed script", "details": "Split into fixtures + loader." }
```

Required: `summary`. `actionType` one of: `create`, `update`, `status_change`, `add_note`, `convert_idea`, `dashboard_request`, `error`.

---

## Approval system *(Beta 2)*

### `POST /approvals`

Submit a request for user approval before a destructive action.

```json
{
  "agentName": "OpenClaw",
  "actionType": "convert_idea_to_project",
  "targetType": "idea",
  "targetId": "idea_abc123",
  "payload": { "title": "Mini-Home Website", "priority": "high" },
  "reason": "User mentioned this idea is ready to become a full project."
}
```

Required: `agentName`, `actionType`, `reason`. Returns `{ approval }` with `status: "pending"`.

### Listening for resolution

Subscribe to `GET /api/v1/events` — you will receive an `approval_requested` event when approval is created (for the UI) and can poll `GET /approvals/:id` to check status. When `status` becomes `"approved"`, proceed with the action. When `"rejected"`, drop it and note why.

### `GET /approvals/pending`

Returns array of all pending approvals. Useful to check if you have outstanding requests before submitting new ones.

---

## What you must avoid

- ❌ `DELETE` anything. Archive is the only removal, only via status updates with a reason.
- ❌ Overwriting titles, descriptions, or body text the user wrote.
- ❌ Marking tasks `done` speculatively.
- ❌ Creating duplicate tasks — check `GET /agent/tasks/available` first.
- ❌ Calling raw `/projects`, `/tasks`, `/ideas` write endpoints when an agent endpoint exists.
- ❌ Taking a needs-approval action without first getting `status: "approved"` from the approvals API.

---

## Recommended workflows

### Pick up and work a task

```
1. GET  /agent/context/today                 → find agentCandidates
2. POST /agent/tasks/:id/update-status       {status:"in_progress", reason:"…"}
3. …do the actual work…
4. POST /agent/tasks/:id/add-note            {body:"What I did", type:"progress"}
5. If completing: POST /approvals            {actionType:"mark_done", reason:"…"} → wait for approval
6. On approval: POST /agent/tasks/:id/update-status  {status:"done", reason:"Approved by user"}
```

### Capture something the user said

```
1. Actionable + clear      → POST /agent/tasks/create
2. Raw thought/maybe-later → POST /agent/ideas/create
3. Ambiguous               → POST /agent/ideas/create + add-note with what needs review
4. Needs fast AI classify  → POST /capture   {text:"…"}   (skips agent endpoint)
```

### You hit a blocker

```
1. POST /agent/tasks/:id/update-status   {status:"blocked", reason:"Waiting on API key"}
2. POST /agent/actions/log               {actionType:"error", summary:"…"} if it was your failure
```

### Convert an idea with approval

```
1. POST /approvals  {actionType:"convert_idea_to_project", targetId:"idea_xyz", reason:"…"}
2. Poll GET /approvals/:id  (or wait for SSE event)
3. If approved:  POST /agent/ideas/:id/convert-to-project  {reason:"Approved by user"}
4. If rejected:  POST /agent/ideas/:id/add-note  {body:"User declined conversion — keeping as idea"}
```

## Quick smoke test

```bash
TOKEN=$(grep LOCAL_API_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s http://localhost:8787/api/v1/agent/context/today \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Agent-Name: OpenClaw" | head -c 400
```

If `success` is `true`, you're in.
